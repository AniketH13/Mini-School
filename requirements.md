Requirements  – Mini School Management Application Suite

This document captures prioritized functional requirements gathered through mock interviews
with three personas: Principal, Teacher, and Parent. Prioritization follows the MoSCoW Method
(Must, Should, Could, Won’t) to guide MVP scope and future iterations.


Stakeholder Interview Scripts

Principal (School Administrator)
Focus: Oversight, reporting, and control.
1. How do you currently track attendance and academic performance across the school?
2. What reports do you need daily or monthly?
3. How do you manage teachers, classes, and users today?
4. What operational issues create the most delays or complaints?
5. What would make a school system successful for you?

Teacher
Focus: Daily usability and classroom efficiency.
1. How do you record attendance and grades currently?
2. How much time can you spend on administrative tasks per class?
3. What information do you need quickly during class?
4. How do you communicate with parents today?
5. What would reduce your daily workload the most?

Parent
Focus: Transparency and communication.
1. How do you track your child’s attendance and grades?
2. How frequently do you want updates from the school?
3. What information causes concern if missing?
4. How do you prefer to receive school communication?
5. What would you expect from a school web app?
